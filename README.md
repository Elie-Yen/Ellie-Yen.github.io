* description:  
My portfolio with abundant interacting effects by typographical design.
Build by react with webpack.

* techs:
 * Use *styled-component* to create responsive values for css attributes by different props / className and speed up layout design.
 * The scrolling effect, lazy-loading and some animations are controlled by using *IntersectionObserver API*, *useRef* and *useEffect* together. They 're triggered when and only when the target elements are in the view (or vice versa); thus increasing the performance.
